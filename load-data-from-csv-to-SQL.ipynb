    "\n",
    "## Reading CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python to read CSV files and extract data from them. For this purpose, we will utilize the Python standard library and its built-in file handling capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading Data with SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the data from the CSV files into a SQL database, we will follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish a connection: Using Python's built-in library for working with SQL databases, we will establish a connection to the desired database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Read the CSV data: Using Python, we will read the CSV files and extract the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Load data into the database: Using SQL queries executed through Python, we will insert the data from the CSV files into the corresponding table in the SQL database."
